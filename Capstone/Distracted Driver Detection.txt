The dataset was downloarded from Kaggle competition - State Farm Distracted Driver Detection.
https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data

The goal of this Kaggle competition is, given driver images, each taken in a car with a driver doing something in the car (texting, eating, talking on the phone, makeup, reaching behind, etc), predict the likelihood of what the driver is doing in each picture. 

Dataset size - 102,150 images divided into training and test data.
Dataset file size - 4GB

The location of the image data set is an Amazon AWS S3 bucket:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/jakefromstatefarm/imgs.zip
The accompanying CSV file outlining the image list is also uploaded in this bucket.
